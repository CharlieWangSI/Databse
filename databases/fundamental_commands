Use the commands above to complete the following tasks, and submit the SQL statements. Real-world examples must be distinct from those used in the text.

> List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.
A: 

Adding: 

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
  VALUES
  (value1, value2, value3);

Updating:

UPDATE table_name SET cell_to_update WHERE column_condition;

Deleting:

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE column_condition;
  

> Explain the structure for each type of command.
A:

Adding: This defines a set of rows that will be inserted into the table. The (column1, column2, column3) is the set of columns that the values correspond to.

Updating: This defines a set of rows that will be updated in the table. Both the SET and WHERE keywords can take multiple clauses.

Deleting: This defines a set of rows that will be deleted from the table. We can use multiple WHERE clauses to specify which records to remove.

> What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world example of each type.

A:

We can use numbers, text, or date & time

EX:

CREATE TABLE contact (
      id integer,
      name text,
      last_contact timestamp,
      still_friend, boolean
  );

INSERT INTO contact (id, name, last_contact)
  VALUES
  (1, ‘charlie wang’, TIMESTAMP '2019-03-24 19:06:00’,true)

> Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.
A: UPDATE spacecrafts SET operational_status=false where id=2134123

> Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have read the email, and the id of the email chain it's in.
